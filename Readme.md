# Quefrency case

Long, elegant, simple. The case fits latest quefrency pcb (rev. 3) in 60%.

## Plate and case files

In `left` and `right` folder there are 3d models and fusion360 source files for both sides of the case. Each folder contains:
- `.f3d` fusion360 source file of both top and bottom
- bottom `.stl` 3d model ready to print
- top `.stl` 3d model ready to print
- top WKL `.stl` 3d model ready to print

Plates are in `plate` folder.

## Mounting

The case uses half gasket mount, which mean you should use gaskets only on bottom case (or bottom of the plate). I personally use 2 short gaskets on each bottom's top and bottom side.

There is plenty of space to use less/more gasket area, more gasket space yields less flexible experience, with short ones even alu plate is quite bouncy.

## Required hardware

- KeebIO rubber feet kit
- brass inserts: M3x3 x 12
- screws: M3x5mm x 8
- screws: M3x12mm x 8
- screws: M3x25mm x 8
- some gaskets

## WKL top

WKL top uses 1.25U blockers on second furthest 1.25U keys from left and right. This is only cause there's no 1.5U 1U 1.5U symmetrical option :(
